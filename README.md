##### Gauge Chart
  The Gauge Chart serves as the pulse monitor for your portfolio. It displays critical metrics such as the total portfolio value, Return on Investment (ROI), and the overall risk level. This chart is designed to give you an immediate understanding of your portfolio's current standing.

##### Pie Chart
The Pie Chart offers a granular view of your asset allocation. It visually represents the percentage of your portfolio invested in various asset classes like stocks, bonds, commodities, etc. This helps you quickly identify if you're overexposed to a particular asset class.

##### Line Graph
The Line Graph is your portfolio's history book. It tracks the performance of your entire portfolio over different timeframes— monthly, quarterly, yearly. You can customize this graph to focus on specific metrics like net value, ROI, or individual asset performance.

### Portfolio Analysis
##### Efficient Frontier Plot
The Efficient Frontier Plot is your risk-return roadmap. It graphically represents the optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk. This is crucial for understanding how to allocate your assets to achieve either maximum return or minimum risk.

##### Optimal Allocation Pie Chart
Based on the Efficient Frontier, this pie chart provides a recommended asset allocation. It suggests how you should distribute your investments among different asset classes to achieve the best risk-adjusted returns.

##### Sharpe Ratio Bar Chart
The Sharpe Ratio Bar Chart is your portfolio's report card. It measures the risk-adjusted performance of your portfolio by comparing its excess return to its volatility. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates that your portfolio is generating a higher return for a given level of risk.

### Technical Analysis
##### Interactive Chart
The Interactive Chart is the dashboard's powerhouse. It combines a candlestick chart for tracking asset prices, a volume bar chart for market activity, and various technical indicators like Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), and On-Balance Volume (OBV). This feature allows you to dive deep into the technical aspects of each asset, offering a more nuanced understanding of market trends
